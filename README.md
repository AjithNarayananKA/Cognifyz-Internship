### **🔹 Level 3: Machine Learning & Visualization**  
✅ **Task 1: Predictive Modeling**  
- Built **Regression Models** to predict **Aggregate Ratings**  
- **Trained & tested models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Evaluated models using **RMSE, MAE, R² Score**  

✅ **Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis**  
- Analyzed relationship between **cuisine types & ratings**  
- Identified **most popular cuisines based on votes**  
- Found **high-rated cuisines**  

✅ **Task 3: Data Visualization**  
- Created **histograms & bar charts** to visualize rating distribution  
- Compared **average ratings of cuisines & cities**  
- Analyzed relationships between **features & target variable**
